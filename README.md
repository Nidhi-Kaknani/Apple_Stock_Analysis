1. The stock data was extracted using the GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets, which retrieves real-time financial market data.
2. After collecting the data in Google Sheets, it was exported as a CSV file and loaded into a Jupyter Notebook using Python for deeper analysis and visualization.
3. Libraries used for data cleaning and data visualization:

   i. pandas for data manipulation
   
   ii. matplotlib & seaborn for basic plots

   iii. plotly.graph_objects for candlestick charts
4.  Analyses Performed:

In this project, multiple analyses were conducted to extract insights from Apple's stock data. The first step involved calculating the monthly mean closing prices, allowing us to observe how the average stock price evolved over the course of 2023. To understand trading activity, we also created a visual representation of the total monthly traded volume, helping identify periods of high and low investor participation. Further, a quarterly trend analysis was performed to assess broader patterns across different fiscal quarters. Additionally, candlestick charts were used to capture detailed daily price movements, including open, high, low, and close prices, providing a clear view of market sentiment and volatility. Lastly, a basic time series analysis was conducted using resampling techniques and trend observation to identify broad patterns and fluctuations in the data.

5. Insights: 

The candlestick charts of Apple Inc. for the year 2023 reveal several insightful trends in the company's stock performance. A strong bullish trend was observed at both the beginning and end of the year, indicating investor optimism and sustained buying pressure during these periods. In contrast, the third quarter exhibited increased volatility, likely stemming from market corrections, macroeconomic shifts, or sector-specific developments such as technology regulation or supply chain constraints.

Notably, the trading volume patterns closely mirrored the price movements, suggesting that major rallies or declines were backed by significant investor participation. This alignment often coincided with Apple’s key product launches, earnings reports, or broader market events, which tend to significantly influence stock sentiment.

The charts also indicate short-term consolidation phases where price movement was range-bound, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty or anticipation ahead of major announcements. Moreover, occasional bearish reversals highlight the dynamic nature of Apple’s stock, reacting to both internal factors and global financial news.

Overall, the time series analysis underscores the importance of tracking quarterly trends and macroeconomic influences when evaluating tech stocks like Apple. The combination of price and volume data provides a more comprehensive understanding of market behavior and investor sentiment throughout the year.
